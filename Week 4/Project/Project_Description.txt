Monitor Doors Remotely 

In this project, I would like to develop an external system which remotely inform 
us whether doors are shut or opened. The push button will be attached to the
closing of door and system will recognize the door is shut until the push button is 
pressed and sends alerts when not.

The use of WiFi Sheild here is to remotely access the information. So, it has a very 
important role to play.
